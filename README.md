# Project Title: 

Power Switch Control Mode using Arduino

# Purpose: 

The purpose of this project is to create a simple implementation of the power switch control mode in mobile phones using an Arduino board. The system allows users to turn on and off a device, such as an LED or LCD screen, by pressing a button on the Arduino.

# Hardware Requirements:

Arduino board (Uno, Nano, or similar)
LED or LCD screen (or any device that can be controlled by a microcontroller)
Button
Breadboard or PCB for prototyping
Jumper wires

# Software Requirements:

Arduino IDE (or similar software for uploading code to the Arduino board)
How to Use:

Connect the LED or LCD screen and button to the Arduino board as shown in the schematic (included in the repository).
Open the Arduino IDE and upload the code to the board.
Power on the board and the device will be off.
Press the button to turn on the device. Press the button again to turn off the device.
